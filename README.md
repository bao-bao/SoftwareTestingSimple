## A function test executor with .xls input

For a new function, only need to new a test class which **implements Test interface** in Test folder, and a **main() function** as test program entry.

For how to code test class and what's the format of input data, simple is fine.

-----
format: only **Text/Number/Boolean/Date** can read 

library needed: [jxl.jar](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjxljar.htm)
